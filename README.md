# Business Focus
The goal of the project was to develop AI-driven solutions for common legal tasks, including content generation. For this project, we developed an AI driven web application to create legal chronologies from a set of given text documents provided by the LegalDuel platform. Chronologies are documents that outline a timeline of events, regarding a legal case. They are typically compiled by an attorney sifting through vast amounts of interviews, emails, and other documents to build a timeline. The purpose of creating this AI web application was to make it eaiser for lawyers to spend less time tediously creating chronologies, so instead they can focus on other pressing issues. Additionally, this project is useful for customers at law firms because with more time, competition, and innovation from our AI tool, law firms can help clients more efficiently for less money. Lastly, our project will our allow for more competition and innovatative solutions since new and unique solutions arise from increased competition, since AI tools are being constantly added into the legal sector.

# Data Preparation and Validation
## Dataset Overview

# Usage
For this project, we developed an AI driven web application to create legal chronologies from a set of given text documents provided by the LegalDuel platform. However, you can upload a pdf file from your personal device or type in the text you want to convert it into a chronology. After you insert the desired text, the web application will generate physical text description of your chronology and you can also download a visual timeline of the chronology.
