# Business Focus
The goal of the project was to develop AI-driven solutions for common legal tasks, including content generation. For this project, we developed an AI driven web application to create legal chronologies from a set of given text documents provided by the LegalDuel platform. However, you can upload a pdf file from your personal device or type in the text you want to convert it into a chronology. After you insert the desired text, the web application will generate physical text description of your chronology and you can download a visual timeline of the chronology.
