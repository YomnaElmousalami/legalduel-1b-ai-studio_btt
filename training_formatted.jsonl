The motor oil was manufactured by the defendant, LubriTech Industries, Inc. ('LubriTech'). The plaintiff used the motor oil in his 2020 Ford Mustang on January 20, 2021, during a routine oil change performed at Speedy Lube, an auto service center in Albany.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, the plaintiff began to notice unusual noises emanating from the engine of his vehicle. Concerned, he took the car back to Speedy Lube on February 7, 2021, where the mechanics conducted a preliminary inspection but found no immediate issues. However, the noises persisted, and on February 15, 2021, the plaintiff's vehicle broke down on the New York State Thruway. Three days later the plaintiff changed the license plates on the car.\n\nThe vehicle was towed to Albany Auto Repair on February 16, 2021. After a thorough inspection, the mechanics discovered significant engine damage, which they attributed to the motor oil used during the last oil change. The plaintiff was informed of this diagnosis on February 18, 2021. The mechanics noted that the motor oil appeared to have degraded prematurely, causing insufficient lubrication and leading to engine failure.\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the plaintiff contacted LubriTech to report the issue and seek compensation for the damages. LubriTech responded on March 10, 2021, denying any fault and asserting that their product met all industry standards. The plaintiff then commissioned an independent laboratory, ChemTest Labs, to analyze the motor oil. The lab results, received on March 25, 2021, indicated that the motor oil contained an excessive amount of a chemical compound known as 'Polymer X,' which is known to cause rapid degradation under high temperatures.\n\nOn April 2, 2021, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Consumer Protection, which initiated an investigation into LubriTech's manufacturing processes. The investigation report, released on May 15, 2021, corroborated the findings of ChemTest Labs, revealing that a batch of motor oil produced on December 10, 2020, contained a higher-than-acceptable level of Polymer X due to a manufacturing error. The report was produced at the end of that month.\n\nOn the day before June 2, 2021, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against LubriTech in the Supreme Court of New York, Albany County, seeking damages for the cost of engine repairs, loss of use of the vehicle, and other related expenses. The case was assigned to Judge Emily Thompson, who scheduled the initial hearing for July 10, 2021.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, which commenced on 8/1/2021, it was revealed that LubriTech had received multiple complaints about the same batch of motor oil. Internal emails from LubriTech, dated August 15, 2021, showed that the company was aware of the issue but chose not to issue a recall or notify consumers.\n\nOn September 5, 2021, the plaintiff's legal team deposed LubriTech's head of quality control, who admitted under oath that the company had identified the contamination on December 20, 2020, but decided against taking corrective action due to cost concerns. This testimony was pivotal in establishing LubriTech's knowledge and negligence. The trial commenced on October 10, 2021, and lasted for three weeks. On October 31, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding him 100,000 in punitive damages. LubriTech filed an appeal on November 15, 2021, challenging both the verdict and the damages awarded.\n\nThe Appellate Division, Third Department, heard the appeal on January 10, 2022, and issued a decision two weeks and three days later, affirming the lower court's ruling. LubriTech then sought leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, which was granted on March 15, 2022. Three days later, the Chief Justice remarked that the appellate lawyers was going to be disbarred for improper conduct.\n\nThe case is now before the New York Court of Appeals, with oral arguments scheduled for June 10, 2024. The plaintiff contends that LubriTech's actions constituted gross negligence and seeks to uphold the lower courts' decisions. The defendant argues that the damages awarded were excessive and that the plaintiff failed to prove causation adequately.\n\nThis case presents significant questions regarding product liability and corporate responsibility, particularly in the context of consumer safety and the duty to inform. The outcome will have far-reaching implications for manufacturers and consumers alike."}, {"role":"assistant", "content": "Chronology of Rosco v. LubriTech Industries, Inc.\n\n1.

The agreement, signed by Plaintiff's CEO, Johnathan Doe, and Defendant's COO, Jane Smith, stipulated the delivery of 10,000 units of high-precision widgets, model XJ-9000, by Defendant to Plaintiff. The total value of the purchase order was $2,500,000, with a delivery deadline set for March 1, 2023.\nOn February 1, 2023, Plaintiff made an advance payment of $1,000,000, as per the terms of the contract, to Defendant's account at Gotham National Bank, Account #987654321. This payment was a significant financial commitment, reflecting the importance of the timely delivery of the widgets for Plaintiff's new product line, the AlphaGadget 3000.\nHowever, on February 15, 2023, Defendant's production facility in Rivendell experienced a minor fire incident, causing a temporary halt in production. The fire was contained within two hours, and no major equipment was damaged. The incident was reported to local authorities and insurance companies. Despite this, Defendant assured Plaintiff via email on February 20, 2023, that the production schedule would not be affected and that the delivery would proceed as planned.\nThe delivery deadline of March 1, 2023, passed without Plaintiff receiving the ordered widgets. Plaintiff's logistics manager, Alice Johnson, contacted Defendant's customer service and was informed that the shipment was delayed due to unforeseen logistical challenges. Subsequently, on March 5, 2023, Defendant sent an official communication to Plaintiff, stating that the delivery would be completed by March 15, 2023. The reason cited was a delay in receiving raw materials from their supplier, Elven Metals Inc., located in Lothl√≥rien.\nPlaintiff's CEO, Johnathan Doe, sent a formal notice of breach of contract to Defendant on March 10, 2023, demanding immediate delivery of the widgets or a full refund of the advance payment. Despite this, on March 15, 2023, Defendant delivered only 2,000 units of the ordered widgets to Plaintiff's warehouse in Metropolis. The remaining 8,000 units were still pending.\nOn March 20, 2023, Plaintiff's legal team, led by attorney Michael Green, sent a second notice to Defendant, reiterating the breach of contract and demanding the remaining units or a refund. Defendant responded on March 25, 2023, stating that the remaining units would be delivered by April 10, 2023, and offered a 5% discount on the pending units as a goodwill gesture.\nThe new delivery deadline of April 10, 2023, passed without the remaining units being delivered. Plaintiff's warehouse manager, Bob Williams, confirmed that no additional shipments were received. Consequently, on April 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendant in the Superior Court of Metropolis, Case #2023-CV-7890, seeking damages for breach of contract, including the advance payment, lost profits, and additional costs incurred due to the delay.\nIt is noteworthy that Plaintiff issued Purchase Order #PO12345 to Defendant on January 20, 2023, specifying the quantity, model, and delivery date. The order was confirmed by Defendant on January 22, 2023. Plaintiff had to source alternative widgets from a different supplier, Dwarven Industries, at a higher cost, to meet their production deadlines. This alternative sourcing was necessary to mitigate the significant impact on Plaintiff's business operations due to the delay, as the widgets were critical components for their new product line.\nDefendant's production facility in Rivendell is known for its state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and has a history of timely deliveries, making this delay an unusual occurrence. The contractual agreement included a clause for liquidated damages at a rate of $10,000 per day for delays beyond the agreed delivery date.\nIn conclusion, the detailed timeline and events highlight the series of communications, assurances, and failures that led to the current dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant. The case revolves around the breach of contract due to delayed delivery of the ordered widgets, causing significant financial and operational impact on Plaintiff."},{"role": "assistant", "content":"Chronology of Dispute Between Corporations on Delivery of Large Purchase Orders\n\n1.

I have been generally healthy throughout my life, with no significant medical issues until recently. In January 2023, I began experiencing severe migraines that were affecting my daily life and work performance. After consulting with my primary care physician, Dr. Emily Smith, she prescribed me a medication called Asterox to help manage the migraines.\nDr. Smith explained that Asterox was a relatively new medication on the market, but it had shown promising results in clinical trials for migraine relief. She assured me that it was safe and that the most common side effects were mild, such as dizziness or nausea. Trusting her professional judgment, I filled the prescription at my local pharmacy and began taking Asterox as directed, which was one 50mg tablet daily.\nFor the first few weeks, Asterox seemed to work well. My migraines became less frequent and less intense, allowing me to resume my normal activities. However, around mid-February 2023, I started noticing small, hard lumps forming on my back. At first, they were barely noticeable and not painful, so I didn't think much of them. I assumed they might be related to stress or a minor skin condition.\nBy March 2023, the lumps had grown larger and more numerous. They were now about the size of marbles and were becoming increasingly painful, especially when I lay down or wore tight clothing. Concerned, I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Smith to discuss these new symptoms. During the examination, Dr. Smith was visibly puzzled and decided to refer me to a dermatologist, Dr. Laura Johnson, for further evaluation.\nDr. Johnson conducted a thorough examination and performed a biopsy on one of the lumps. The results showed that the lumps were benign lipomas, which are non-cancerous growths of fatty tissue. However, Dr. Johnson was concerned about the sudden onset and rapid growth of these lipomas. She asked me about any recent changes in my medication or lifestyle, and I mentioned that I had started taking Asterox in January.\nDr. Johnson suggested that Asterox might be the cause of the lipomas, as there had been some anecdotal reports of similar side effects in other patients. She advised me to stop taking Asterox immediately and to report the adverse reaction to the FDA. I followed her advice and discontinued the medication. Within a few weeks, the growth of new lumps stopped, but the existing ones remained and continued to cause discomfort.\nIn April 2023, I contacted the manufacturer of Asterox, PharmaCorp Inc., to report my adverse reaction and seek further guidance. They acknowledged my report but did not provide any substantial information or assistance. Frustrated and in pain, I decided to seek legal counsel to explore my options for holding PharmaCorp accountable for the harm caused by their medication.\nMy attorney, Jane Williams, helped me file a lawsuit against PharmaCorp in June 2023, alleging that Asterox was defectively designed and that the company failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential risk of developing lipomas. As part of the discovery process, I have provided detailed medical records, photographs of the lumps, and testimony from both Dr. Smith and Dr. Johnson.\nThe impact of this ordeal on my life has been significant. The pain and discomfort from the lipomas have affected my ability to sleep, work, and engage in physical activities. I have also experienced emotional distress and anxiety, worrying about the long-term effects of these growths and the possibility of needing surgical removal. My quality of life has been severely diminished, and I am seeking compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.\nIn summary, my experience with Asterox has been a nightmare. What started as a promising solution for my migraines turned into a painful and distressing condition that has left me with permanent physical and emotional scars. I hope that through this lawsuit, I can obtain justice and prevent others from suffering similar harm."},{"role": "assistant", "content":"Chronology for John Doe v. Asterox\n\n1.

The table in question is the 'Elysian Oak Dining Table,' which I ordered online from your website on June 15, 2024, and received on June 25, 2024. The order number for this purchase is #EO123456789.\nUpon receiving the table, I was initially impressed with its aesthetic appeal and craftsmanship. However, my satisfaction was short-lived as the table began to exhibit significant malfunctions shortly after its assembly. I would like to provide a detailed account of the issues encountered, including specific dates and times, to facilitate a thorough investigation and resolution.\nAssembly and Initial Use:\n\nJune 25, 2024, 3:00 PM: The table was delivered to my residence by your logistics partner, Arcane Delivery Services. The delivery personnel, Mr. Thaddeus Quill and Ms. Seraphina Blythe, were courteous and professional.\n\nJune 26, 2024, 10:00 AM: I began assembling the table following the instructions provided in the manual. The assembly process took approximately three hours, concluding at 1:00 PM. The table appeared sturdy and well-constructed at this point.\n\nJune 26, 2024, 7:00 PM: My family and I used the table for dinner. It comfortably accommodated six people, and there were no immediate signs of any issues.\n\nFirst Signs of Malfunction:\n\nJuly 1, 2024, 8:00 AM: I noticed a slight wobble in the table when placing a cup of coffee on it. Initially, I attributed this to uneven flooring and adjusted the table's position.\nJuly 3, 2024, 6:00 PM: The wobble became more pronounced during dinner. I inspected the table and found that one of the legs appeared to be slightly loose. I tightened the screws, hoping this would resolve the issue.\n\nEscalation of the Problem:\nJuly 10, 2024, 9:00 AM: The table's wobble had worsened significantly. I contacted your customer service hotline and spoke with Ms. Ophelia Nightshade. She advised me to check all the screws and bolts and ensure they were securely fastened.\nJuly 10, 2024, 11:00 AM: Following Ms. Nightshade's advice, I rechecked and tightened all screws and bolts. Despite this, the wobble persisted.\nJuly 15, 2024, 7:00 PM: During a family gathering, the table's instability became a major concern. The table wobbled excessively, causing a glass of water to spill. This incident was not only inconvenient but also potentially hazardous.\n\nCritical Malfunction:\nJuly 20, 2024, 12:00 PM: While hosting a lunch for friends, the table's condition deteriorated further. One of the legs gave way completely, causing the table to collapse partially. Fortunately, no one was injured, but several dishes and glasses were broken.\nJuly 21, 2024, 10:00 AM: I contacted your customer service department again and spoke with Mr. Alaric Thornfield. He expressed regret for the inconvenience and assured me that a technician would be dispatched to inspect the table.\nJuly 23, 2024, 2:00 PM: A technician named Mr. Gideon Ravenscroft arrived to inspect the table. After a thorough examination, he concluded that there was a manufacturing defect in the leg joints, which compromised the table's stability.\n\nCurrent Status and Request for Resolution:\nAugust 1, 2024, 9:00 AM: Despite the technician's visit, I have not received any follow-up communication regarding the next steps for resolving this issue. The table remains unusable, and I am deeply disappointed with the lack of progress.\nAugust 15, 2024, 4:00 PM: I attempted to contact your customer service department once more but was unable to reach a representative after being on hold for over 30 minutes.\nGiven the detailed account of the issues faced and the inconvenience caused, I kindly request the following:\nA full refund of the purchase price of the table.\nCompensation for the damaged dishes and glasses, totaling $150.\nImmediate collection of the defective table from my residence.\n\nI have always held Esoteric Furniture Co. in high regard and hope that this matter can be resolved promptly and satisfactorily. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the resolution of this complaint. I can be reached at (555) 123-4567 or via email at customer.email@example.com.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Could you please confirm that Ms. Nightshade will provide a written summary of our follow-up conversation on August 25, 2024?\n\nAdditional Concerns:\nAugust 10, 2024, 2:00 PM: I noticed that one of the screws used to secure the table legs had stripped threads, which may have contributed to the instability. This was not mentioned during Mr. Ravenscroft's initial inspection.\nAugust 18, 2024, 5:00 PM: I attempted to stabilize the table temporarily by using a makeshift support, but this was only a short-term solution and did not address the underlying issues.\n\nI hope these additional details will assist in your investigation and resolution of the matter. I look forward to your confirmation and further instructions.\nThank you once again for your attention to this issue.\nSincerely,\nJohnathan A.

However, I would like to add further details and request additional assurances.\nAdditional Details:\n\nJune 30, 2024, 4:00 PM: I noticed a minor scratch on the table's surface, which I initially dismissed as a minor cosmetic issue. However, this may be relevant to the overall quality concerns.\nJuly 5, 2024, 9:00 AM: I observed that the table's finish appeared to be uneven in certain areas, particularly around the edges. This was not immediately noticeable but became more apparent over time.\nJuly 12, 2024, 3:00 PM: During a routine cleaning, I found that the table's surface was more prone to staining than expected, despite following the care instructions provided in the manual.\n\nAdditional Concerns:\n\nInspection Thoroughness: Could you please ensure that Mr. Ravenscroft conducts a thorough inspection of the entire table, including the surface finish and any potential structural weaknesses, during his visit on August 24, 2024?\nReplacement Assurance: While I appreciate the offer of a complimentary replacement, I would like to request a detailed report on the quality checks performed on the replacement table before it is delivered.

Can you please state your full name for the record?\nJames Parker: My name is James Robert Parker.\nLaura Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Parker. What is your current occupation?\nJames Parker: I am the Chief Operating Officer of Texan Paints Inc., a leading paint manufacturer based in Texas.\nLaura Thompson: Could you provide a brief history of Texan Paints Inc.?\nJames Parker: Certainly. Texan Paints Inc. was established on 01/07/1992 by my father, William Parker. The company started as a small business catering to local hardware stores. Over the years, we expanded our operations and now supply paint products to several large retail chains and construction companies across the United States.\nLaura Thompson: When did you assume the role of COO?\nJames Parker: I became the COO on 01/01/2015, after serving in various other capacities within the company.\nLaura Thompson: Can you outline some of the major milestones for Texan Paints Inc. since you took over as COO?\nJames Parker: Certainly. In 2016, we launched our eco-friendly paint line, which was a significant success. On 15/03/2017, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Houston, which increased our production capacity by 30%. In 2019, we entered into a strategic partnership with HomeSafe Solutions to develop lead-free paint products. And most recently, on 10/05/2023, we completed the acquisition of ColorMax Paints, a regional competitor.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any challenges the company faced during this period?\nJames Parker: Yes, we faced several challenges. In 2018, we encountered a significant issue with a batch of paint that did not meet our quality standards, which led to a product recall on 15/08/2018. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused supply chain disruptions and a temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facilities from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. We also dealt with a patent infringement lawsuit in 2021, which was resolved in our favor on 01/12/2021.\nLaura Thompson: Can you explain the significance of the eco-friendly paint line launched in 2016?\nJames Parker: The eco-friendly paint line was significant because it aligned with growing consumer demand for environmentally responsible products. It also helped us tap into new markets and attract environmentally conscious customers. The line was fully certified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 01/09/2016.\nLaura Thompson: You mentioned a strategic partnership with HomeSafe Solutions. Can you elaborate on that?\nJames Parker: Of course. The partnership with HomeSafe Solutions began on 01/06/2019, focusing on developing lead-free paint products. This collaboration allowed us to leverage their expertise in safe home products and combine it with our manufacturing capabilities. The first lead-free paint product was launched on 01/02/2020.\nLaura Thompson: How has the acquisition of ColorMax Paints impacted Texan Paints Inc.?\nJames Parker: The acquisition of ColorMax Paints, completed on 10/05/2023, has significantly expanded our market share in the southwestern United States. It also brought in new technologies that we have integrated into our production processes. The full integration of ColorMaxs operations was completed by 01/09/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any significant dates related to product recalls or quality issues since 2018?\nJames Parker: Yes, in addition to the recall on 15/08/2018, we had another minor recall on 01/03/2022 due to a mislabeled batch of paint. The issue was quickly addressed, and corrective measures were implemented to prevent future occurrences.\nLaura Thompson: Can you provide more details about your response to the COVID-19 pandemic?\nJames Parker: Certainly. During the temporary shutdown from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020, we implemented remote working protocols for our administrative staff and enhanced health and safety measures at our manufacturing facilities. By 01/07/2020, we resumed operations with reduced capacity and gradually scaled up production as conditions improved.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any technological advancements adopted during the pandemic to cope with disruptions?\nJames Parker: Yes, we accelerated our digital transformation efforts. On 01/05/2020, we implemented an advanced inventory management system to improve supply chain visibility. Additionally, we invested in automation technologies for our Houston facility, which were fully operational by 01/11/2020.\nLaura Thompson: How did these advancements impact your overall business performance?\nJames Parker: These advancements resulted in a more resilient operation. By the end of 2020, we saw a 15% increase in operational efficiency and a 10% reduction in production costs compared to the previous year. Our ability to quickly adapt also strengthened our relationships with key clients.\nLaura Thompson: I believe there was a correction needed regarding a previous date mentioned. Could you clarify that?\nJames Parker: Yes, I previously mentioned that the product recall due to quality issues occurred on 15/08/2018, but the correct date is actually 01/09/2018.\nLaura Thompson: Thank you for the clarification. Are there any future projects or expansions you can share with us?\nJames Parker: Yes, we are planning to open a new research and development center in Austin on 01/06/2025. This center will focus on innovative paint technologies and sustainable products. Additionally, we are exploring potential collaborations with academic institutions to drive further innovation. The initial planning phase started on 01/09/2024, and construction is expected to begin by 01/01/2025.\nLaura Thompson: Thank you, Mr. Parker. That concludes my questions for today.\n \nTestimony of Mr. James Parker\nContinued Examination by Attorney Laura Thompson of Thompson & Associates\nLaura Thompson: Good afternoon again, Mr. Parker. Lets continue from where we left off. Could you elaborate on the environmental initiatives Texan Paints Inc. has undertaken recently?\nJames Parker: Certainly. On 01/10/2022, we launched our 'Green Horizons' initiative, which aims to reduce our carbon footprint by 30% by 2025. This initiative includes converting our delivery fleet to electric vehicles, which we started on 15/11/2022, and installing solar panels at our Houston manufacturing facility by 01/03/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Have there been any challenges associated with these environmental initiatives?\nJames Parker: Yes, the installation of solar panels faced delays due to supply chain issues. Initially scheduled for completion by 01/03/2023, the project was pushed to 01/05/2023. Additionally, the transition to electric vehicles encountered logistical challenges, causing a delay from the original date of 15/11/2022 to 01/01/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Can you provide more details on the 'Green Horizons' initiative?\nJames Parker: Of course. As part of the 'Green Horizons' initiative, we also committed to using 100% recyclable packaging by 01/07/2023. We partnered with EcoPack Solutions on 01/12/2022 to develop this packaging. The first batch of recyclable packaging was rolled out on 01/08/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any significant dates related to the development of this recyclable packaging?\nJames Parker: Yes, the design phase began on 01/01/2023, and we completed testing by 15/05/2023. However, there was a delay in obtaining certification, which was originally expected by 01/06/2023 but was not received until 01/07/2023.\nLaura Thompson: How has the acquisition of ColorMax Paints influenced your product lines?\nJames Parker: The acquisition of ColorMax Paints, finalized on 10/05/2023, has allowed us to integrate their unique color-matching technology into our products. By 01/07/2023, we launched a new premium line of paints featuring this technology. This has significantly enhanced our product offerings and market competitiveness.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any challenges during the integration of ColorMax Paints?\nJames Parker: Yes, we faced some integration issues with their IT systems. Initially planned for completion by 01/06/2023, it was delayed to 01/08/2023. Additionally, there were some cultural differences between the teams, which we addressed through joint team-building activities starting on 01/07/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Can you tell us more about the strategic partnership with HomeSafe Solutions?\nJames Parker: Certainly. Our partnership with HomeSafe Solutions, which began on 01/06/2019, focuses on developing lead-free and non-toxic paint products. The first product from this collaboration, a lead-free interior paint, was launched on 01/02/2020. This product line has been particularly popular among families and educational institutions.\nLaura Thompson: Have there been any significant updates or expansions in this partnership?\nJames Parker: Yes, on 15/01/2023, we expanded our partnership to include the development of non-toxic exterior paints. The first batch of these products was tested successfully on 01/06/2023, and we plan to launch them commercially by 01/11/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Were there any challenges during the development of these non-toxic exterior paints?\nJames Parker: Yes, we faced formulation challenges that delayed the initial testing phase from 01/03/2023 to 01/06/2023. Additionally, we encountered regulatory hurdles that required additional certification, pushing our expected launch date from 01/09/2023 to 01/11/2023.\nLaura Thompson: I believe there was a correction needed regarding a previous date mentioned. Could you clarify that?\nJames Parker: Yes, I previously mentioned that the design phase for the recyclable packaging began on 01/01/2023, but the correct date is actually 01/02/2023.\nLaura Thompson: Thank you for the correction. Are there any future projects or expansions you can share with us?\nJames Parker: Yes, we are planning to open a new distribution center in Dallas on 01/04/2025.

Let us delve deeper into the specifics of your recent projects and initiatives. Can you provide more details on the new R&D center planned for Austin?\nJames Parker: Certainly. The R&D center in Austin is a major strategic initiative for Texan Paints Inc. The planning phase began on 01/09/2024, with the goal of focusing on advanced paint technologies and sustainable product development. We aim to break ground on 01/01/2025 and complete construction by 01/12/2025.\nLaura Thompson: Have there been any key milestones achieved in the planning of this R&D center?\nJames Parker: Yes, we secured the land for the R&D center on 15/09/2024. Additionally, we finalized the architectural design on 01/10/2024 and received the necessary zoning permits on 15/10/2024. We are currently in the process of selecting contractors, which we expect to finalize by 01/11/2024.\nLaura Thompson: Can you elaborate on the collaboration with local universities for research purposes?\nJames Parker: Absolutely. We initiated discussions with the University of Texas at Austin on 01/07/2024. By 01/09/2024, we had formalized a partnership agreement to collaborate on research projects related to eco-friendly paint formulations.
